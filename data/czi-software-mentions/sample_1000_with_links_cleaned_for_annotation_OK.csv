Their 10,600 square foot, high-complexity CLIA licensed lab facility is equipped with the latest high-throughput robotics and Affymetrix, Illumina and Sequenom genotyping equipment. As scientists committed to staying on the cutting-edge, they diligently monitor all new developments in the rapidly evolving DNA research field allowing us to provide you immediate access to more meaningful markers than any other DNA testing firm. - Better Security: Because Pathway Genomics has its own laboratory, your DNA never leaves the building, and is never shared with third parties. At Pathway Genomics the integrity of your genetic material and information are protected. Instead, enjoy the security of our proprietary DNA Lockbox. Everyone has the right to know the secrets hidden within their own DNA. That's why Pathway has created the most secure, comprehensive and affordable way to unlock those secrets. This way you can: - Identify genetic health and drug response - Personalize your medical care - Help your doctor help you - Uncover your ancestral path - Explore the traits that make you unique With Personal DNA Testing, you can take preventative steps to improve your future, and even extend your life. Pathway Genomics provides cutting-edge research and easy-to-read scientific information customized for you, and you alone, based on your genes and your lifestyle. For the first time in human history, modern science has made it possible for you to learn your genetic predisposition for more than 90 diseases and conditions, drug responses and pre-pregnancy carrier status. With this powerful knowledge and our easy-to-understand guidance, you can modify your health regime so that you may live a healthier, longer life. DNA testing will discover more about your personal heritage than you ever thought possible. We uncover your deep ancestry by taking giant leaps into the past, going back more than 10,000 years. We test both your mitochondrial DNA, which is passed down from mother to child and reveals your direct maternal ancestry; and your Y chromosome (males only), which is passed down from father to son and reveals your direct paternal ancestry. If you're like most people, you've always wondered about the genes you have inherited and what traits you will pass on to future generations. Discover your genetically inherited predispositions and characteristics and whether they are beneficial or potentially harmful.

It features over 25 performance measures that can be freely combined to create two-dimensional performance curves. Standard methods for investigating trade-offs between specific performance measures are available within a uniform framework, including receiver operating characteristic (ROC) graphs, precision/recall plots, lift charts and cost curves. ROCR integrates tightly with R''s powerful graphics capabilities, thus allowing for highly adjustable plots. Being equipped with only three commands and reasonable default values for optional parameters, ROCR combines flexibility with ease of usage. Performance measures that ROCR knows: Accuracy, error rate, true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate, false negative rate, sensitivity, specificity, recall, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, precision, fallout, miss, phi correlation coefficient, Matthews correlation coefficient, mutual information, chi square statistic, odds ratio, lift value, precision/recall F measure, ROC convex hull, area under the ROC curve, precision/recall break-even point, calibration error, mean cross-entropy, root mean squared error, SAR measure, expected cost, explicit cost. ROCR features: ROC curves, precision/recall plots, lift charts, cost curves, custom curves by freely selecting one performance measure for the x axis and one for the y axis, handling of data from cross-validation or bootstrapping, curve averaging (vertically, horizontally, or by threshold), standard error bars, box plots, curves that are color-coded by cutoff, printing threshold values on the curve, tight integration with Rs plotting facilities (making it easy to adjust plots or to combine multiple plots), fully customizable, easy to use (only 3 commands).

Most informatic tools currently available were conceived essentially for the analysis of coding sequences. Non-coding sequences present however a striking interest since they govern the regulation of gene expression. This site offers a series of tools dedicated to the detection of regulatory signals in non-coding sequences. The only input required is a list of genes of interest (e.g. a family of co-regulated genes). From this information, you can retrieve the upstream sequences over a desired distance, discover putative regulatory signals, search the matching positions for these signals in your original dataset or in whole genomes, and display the results graphically in the form of a feature map. Abstract The preparation of an appropriate sequence dataset is the starting point of all genomic analyses. We present retrieve-ensembl-seq, an application that considerably eases the retrieval of sequences from the Ensembl database, via our user-friendly web site or web services. The user provides Ensembl identifiers or gene names, and the program returns corresponding upstream, downstream, intronic, exonic, UTR or whole gene sequences. retrieve-ensembl-seq also offers a multiple organism mode to retrieve sequences from homologous genes at any taxonomical level. And we introduce various original filters such as the masking of coding fragments and the avoidance of sequence redundancy for genes with multiple transcripts. retrieve-ensembl-seq is included in the software suite regulatory sequence analysis tools (RSAT), allowing instant submission of retrieved sequences to further analysis tools. AVAILABILITY: retrieve-ensembl-seq is integrated in the RSAT suite: http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat. Web site: http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/retrieve-ensembl-seq_form.cgi. Web services: http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/rsat/web_services/RSATWS.wsdl. Stand-alone distribution: freely available under an academic licence to download from the RSAT web site.

The BioMoby project was initiated in 2001 from within the model organism database community. It aimed to standardize methodologies to facilitate information exchange and access to analytical resources, using a consensus driven approach. Six years later, the BioMoby development community is pleased to announce the release of the 1.0 version of the interoperability framework, registry Application Programming Interface and supporting Perl and Java code-bases. Together, these provide interoperable access to over 1400 bioinformatics resources worldwide through the BioMoby platform, and this number continues to grow. Here we highlight and discuss the features of BioMoby that make it distinct from other Semantic Web Service and interoperability initiatives, and that have been instrumental to its deployment and use by a wide community of bioinformatics service providers.

Another useful feature of LAST is that it can compare huge (vertebrate-genome-sized) datasets. Unfortunately, this only applies to the downloadable version of LAST, not the web service. The web service can just about handle bacterial genomes, but it will take a few minutes and the output will be large. LAST can: * Handle big sequence data, e.g: ** Compare two vertebrate genomes ** Align billions of DNA reads to a genome * Indicate the reliability of each aligned column. * Use sequence quality data properly. * Compare DNA to proteins, with frameshifts. * Compare PSSMs to sequences * Calculate the likelihood of chance similarities between random sequences. LAST cannot (yet): * Do spliced alignment The main way of analyzing biological sequences is by comparing and aligning them to each other. It remains difficult, however, to compare modern multi-billionbase DNA data sets. The difficulty is caused by the nonuniform (oligo)nucleotide composition of these sequences, rather than their size per se. To solve this problem, we modified the standard seed-and-extend approach (e.g., BLAST) to use adaptive seeds. Adaptive seeds are matches that are chosen based on their rareness, instead of using fixed-length matches. This method guarantees that the number of matches, and thus the running time, increases linearly, instead of quadratically, with sequence length. LAST, our open source implementation of adaptive seeds, enables fast and sensitive comparison of large sequences with arbitrarily nonuniform composition.",['http://last.cbrc.jp/'],['https://bio.tools/last'],[None],TRUE,SCR_006119,"['http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21209072, 20144198, 20110255', '(LAST, RRID:SCR_006119)']","['single-stranded dna-binding protein 3', 'ssdp', 'lck-associated signal transducer', 'sequence-specific single-stranded-dna-binding protein', 'ssbp3', 'ssdp1', 'last']",,,,,,,,,,,

As a first step, the PSI is developing standards for two key areas of proteomics: mass spectrometry and protein-protein interaction data. The document describes the molecular interaction data exchange format. PSI is following a leveled approach to building this specification. Level 1 will describe protein interactions at a basic level that covers a large amount of currently available data. Subsequent levels will add capability to represent new molecular interaction information that the community wishes to exchange. The scope of PSI MI is currently limited to protein-protein interactions. Other molecules, such as small molecules, DNA and RNA maybe taken into account in the future. The PSI MI format is a data exchange format for protein-protein interactions. It is not a proposed database structure. The purpose of the document is to describe the general structure of the PSI MI XML specification in a more user-friendly manner than the specification does itself.
