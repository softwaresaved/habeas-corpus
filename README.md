# Habeas Corpus

This is work done during the hack day at [Collaborations Workshop 2021](https://www.software.ac.uk/cw21), to create a **corpus of research software used for COVID-19 and coronavirus-related research** that will be useful in a number of ways to the research software sustainability community around the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk/). This is based on and extends the "CORD-19 Software Mentions" dataset published by the Chan Zuckerberg Institute (doi: https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.vmcvdncs0).

This project originated as part of the Collaborations Workshop 2021.

It was based on an original idea by Neil Chue Hong (@npch) and Stephan Druskat (@sdruskat), incorporated ideas and feedback from Michelle Barker, Daniel S. Katz, Shoaib Sufi, Carina Haupt and Callum Rollo, and was developed by Alexander Konovalov (@alex-konovalov), Hao Ye (@ha0ye), Louise Chisholm (@LouiseChisholm), Mark Turner (@MarkLTurner), Neil Chue Hong (@npch), Sammie Buzzard (@sammiebuzzard), and Stephan Druskat (@sdruskat).

The data is derived from the ["CORD-19 Software Mentions"](https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi:10.5061/dryad.vmcvdncs0) dataset published by Alex D Wade and Alana Williams from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative and released under a CC0 license. 
This work is also bsaed on the [Softcite dataset](https://github.com/howisonlab/softcite-dataset) [v1.0](https://github.com/howisonlab/softcite-dataset/releases/tag/v1.0):
